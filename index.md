Welcome! This is the page of our tutorial "<b>Towards Secure and Robust Recommender Systems: Recent Advances and Future Prospectives</b>" at The Web Conference (WSDM) 2025.

### Description

Recommender systems (RS) have proven to be vulnerable to malicious activities, where harmful data is injected into training datasets or model gradients are manipulated. These attacks compromise system functionality and distort RS objectives, allowing exploitation for malicious purposes. While significant research has been dedicated to understanding attack methods and their weaknesses, defensive strategies to protect RS from these vulnerabilities remain underexplored. This tutorial addresses secure and robust recommendations by exploring three critical research questions: (1) From the secure recommender system perspective, understanding the factors involved in executing successful attacks and exploring techniques to enhance system security; (2) From the robust recommender system perspective, addressing the challenges posed by maliciously injected and noisy data, and examining methods such as data denoising and model enhancement to improve system resilience; (3) Identifying research limitations and future opportunities, particularly the role of large language models in creating new vulnerabilities for attackers and offering novel defensive strategies for defenders. Additionally, the tutorial will culminate in the release of a toolkit designed to support empirical analysis and foster future research innovations in secure and robust recommendations.

### Targeted Audience

  This tutorial is designed for a broad audience, including academic and industrial researchers, graduate students, and practitioners from the recommendation field and related areas. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have a solid understanding of basic poisoning attacks and defensive strategies to enhance the robustness and security of recommendation systems. Additionally, they will gain hands-on experience using an open-source toolkit. While prior knowledge of recommendation systems is preferred, the tutorial will also cover foundational concepts to ensure better engagement and accessibility for all attendees.
