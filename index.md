### Description

As recommender systems (RS) continue to evolve, the field has seen a pivotal shift from model-centric to data-centric paradigms, where the quality, integrity, and security of data are increasingly becoming the key drivers of system performance and personalization. This transformation has unlocked new avenues for more precise and tailored recommendations, yet it also introduces significant challenges. As reliance on data intensifies, RS face mounting threats that can compromise both their effectiveness and user trust. These challenges include (1) Malicious Data Manipulation, where adversaries corrupt or tamper with datasets, distorting recommendation outcomes and undermining system reliability; (2) Data Privacy Leakage, where adversarial actors exploit system outputs to infer sensitive user information, leading to serious privacy concerns; and (3) Erroneous Data Noise, where inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and redundant data obscure the true user preferences, degrading recommendation quality and user satisfaction. By focusing on these critical data-centric challenges, this tutorial aims to equip participants with the knowledge to build RS that are secure, privacy-preserving, and resilient to data-driven threats, ensuring reliable and trustworthy performance in real-world environments. In addition, attendees will gain hands-on experience with our newly released toolkit for RS-based attacks and defenses, providing them with practical, actionable insights into safeguarding RS against emerging vulnerabilities.
